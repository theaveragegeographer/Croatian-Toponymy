# Croatian-Toponymy

A repository focused on helping people with Croatian Family History using the power and science of toponymy, the geography of placenames!

## Overview

If you've ever struggled with tracing your Croatian family history, you're not alone! Croatian placenames are often closely associated with surnames, as families and distant relatives have lived in the same houses and villages for hundreds of years. This repository provides a structured workspace for researching Croatian toponymy and genealogy using geographic and spatial analysis methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For working with spatial data and toponymy analysis, you may need:
- Python 3.x with libraries: geopandas, pandas, shapely, fiona
- R with spatial packages (optional)
- QGIS or similar GIS software for visualization
- Basic knowledge of Croatian geography and naming conventions

### Using This Repository

1. **Collecting Data**: Place your data sources in the appropriate `data/` subdirectories
   - Shapefiles and spatial data → `data/shapefiles/`
   - Raw data files → `data/raw/`
   - Processed, analysis-ready data → `data/processed/`

2. **Organizing Scripts**: Store your analysis and processing code in `scripts/`
   - Analysis scripts → `scripts/analysis/`
   - Data processing scripts → `scripts/processing/`

3. **Documentation**: Keep notes, methodologies, and findings in `docs/`

## Research Methodology

### Surname-Placename Connections

Croatian surnames often derive from:
- Geographic locations (toponyms)
- Patronymic names
- Occupations
- Physical characteristics

By analyzing placenames and their distributions, you can:
- Identify potential ancestral villages
- Trace migration patterns
- Find clusters of related families
- Discover historical settlement patterns

### Key Resources

- Croatian State Geodetic Administration (DGU) - Official spatial data
- Croatian Census Data - Population and surname distributions
- Church Records - Historical family and location data
- OpenStreetMap - Current geographic data

## Contributing
